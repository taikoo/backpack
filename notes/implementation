========

Overview:
---------

backpack is (currently) an Android application service, which facilitates the
sharing and dissemination of files over LANs (for now) using a gossip protocol.
backpack handles all event registration and socket programming etc. and
provides a single API to client applications.

An application can request backpack to:

	- return a list of available streams.
	- create a new stream.
	- share an item with a named stream.

backpack in turn handles:

	- the creation and destruction of streams.
	- the backpack protocol
	- data tx and rx
	- data encryption
	- peer authentication (?)

Examples of user applications:

	- file sharing
	- community newsfeed
	- distributed file system

Definitions:
------------

	- "item" - an object to share. All items are attached to one or more streams.
	- "stream" - channel this item is to be shared on.
